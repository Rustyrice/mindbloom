Frameworks Used

Front-End Framework: React.js

Several team members had proficiency in React.js, ensuring a smooth development experience for the project.
Back-End Framework: Node.js with JavaScript

Node.js was selected to ensure compatibility between the front-end and back-end of the software.
Extensive research was conducted on various frameworks, including Prisma, Firebase, and Supabase. Ultimately, Node.js was chosen due to its versatility and compatibility with relational databases, which proved essential for user verification and data integration.
Key Features

Revision Tracker:

MindBloom includes a comprehensive revision tracker designed to help users effectively manage their time when studying and reviewing course materials.
The Pomodoro technique, consisting of 25-minute work intervals followed by 5-minute breaks, serves as the foundation for task allocation and time management within the revision tracker.
Well-being Tracker:

The well-being tracker in MindBloom focuses on hydration and sleep, acknowledging the crucial role these factors play in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Users can track their daily water intake and monitor their sleep patterns, promoting overall well-being and energizing the body.
Survey-Driven Development Process
To ensure MindBloom caters to the needs of its target users, a comprehensive survey was conducted among over 100 students. The survey helped gather valuable insights and specification points, enabling the team to optimize the software's features and functionalities.

Key survey outcomes:

Fitness tracker: Though initially considered, the survey results indicated that participants were already engaging in a healthy amount of physical activity, rendering a separate fitness tracker unnecessary.
Revision tracker and well-being tracker: These two features emerged as the primary focus based on user preferences and requirements.
The team utilized the survey data to shape the development process, aligning MindBloom with the expectations and desires of its intended users.
